You shall have no other gods before Me
You shall not make idols
You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain
Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy
Honor your father and your mother
You shall not murder
You shall not commit adultery
You shall not steal
You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor
You shall not covet
